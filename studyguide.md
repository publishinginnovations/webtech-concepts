**Key Concepts & Terms in Web Technologies**

At some point during the term there will be a quiz on key concepts and
terms in web technologies. The following is a list of concepts and terms
that you should understand in order to have a professional conversation
with web developers and designers. The fifty-question quiz will be a
combination of short-answer, fill-in-the-blank, and multiple-choice
answers. Each question will count for 1 point. You will be given the
opportunity to retake the quiz and have the average of both attempts
count as the final score for the quiz.

**Preparing for the quiz**

The video Web Development Foundations: Web Technologies on Lynda.com
explains each of these topics. If you have difficulty understanding any
of the terms, you should Google the term for an explanation. If you
still have difficulty understanding a concept, ask the question in class
or make an appointment to talk with me about the topic.
